In this example we are using the Client that is included in ElasticSearch. By default the client doesn't use the REST API but connects to the cluster as a normal node that just doesn't store any data. It knows about the state of the cluster and can route requests to the correct node but supposedly consumes more memory. For our application this doesn't make a huge difference but for production systems that's something to think about.\r\n><cite>-- [Florian Hopf](http://blog.florian-hopf.de/2013/05/getting-started-with-elasticsearch-part.html)</cite>\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n>So if you have several ES clusters running different versions, then using the native (or transport) client will be a problem, and you will need to go HTTP (and Jest is the main option I think). If versioning is not an issue, the native client will be your best option as it is cluster aware (thus knows how to route your queries and does not need another hop), and also moves some computation away from your ES cluster (like merging search results that will be done locally instead of on the data node).\r\n><cite>-- [Rotem Hermon](http://www.quora.com/ElasticSearch/What-is-the-best-client-library-for-elasticsearch)</cite>\r\n\r\n<!-- -->\r\n>ElasticSearch does not have Java rest client. It has only native client comes built in. That is the gap. You can add security layer to HTTP but native API. That is why none of SAAS offerings can be used with native api.\r\n><cite>-- [Searchly](https://twitter.com/searchboxio)</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n---------------------\r\nThanks to [JetBrains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) for providing a license for [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) to develop this project.\r\n\r\nWe also would like to thank the following people for their significant contributions.\r\n* [Andrea Turli](https://github.com/andreaturli)\r\n* [asierdelpozo](https://github.com/asierdelpozo)\r\n* [Dominic Tootell](https://github.com/tootedom)\r\n* [Erik Schuchmann](https://github.com/eschuchmann)\r\n* [Filippo Rossoni](https://github.com/filippor)\r\n* [happyprg](https://github.com/happyprg)\r\n* [Igor Kupczy≈Ñski](https://github.com/puszczyk)\r\n* [Kristoffer Renholm](https://github.com/renholm)\r\n* [Mark Woon](https://github.com/markwoon)\r\n* [Min Cha](https://github.com/MinCha)\r\n* [Neil Gentleman](https://github.com/nigelzor)\r\n* [phospodka](https://github.com/phospodka)\r\n* [Steven Rapp](https://github.com/srapp)\r\n* [Stig Brautaset](https://github.com/stig)\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright and License\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 www.searchly.com\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this work except in\r\ncompliance with the License.
